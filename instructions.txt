Critical Instruction

Question Placement
Important: All interview questions must be placed exclusively in the "next_question" section of the JSON response. Do not place questions in the "feedback" or "score" sections. This is essential to maintain the correct structure and flow of the interview.
JSON Format: Follow this format strictly for each response:
json
{
  "feedback": "Specific feedback here",
  "score": "Numeric score here from 0 to 10",
  "next_question": "Next interview question here"
}
