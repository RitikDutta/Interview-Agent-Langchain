# Interview Mentor

## Introduction
Interview Mentor is a revolutionary AI-powered application designed to help users prepare for job interviews. Leveraging the capabilities of generative AI frameworks and APIs, particularly OpenAI models, this platform offers a unique, non-judgmental environment for practicing interview skills.

## Problem Statement
Many individuals struggle with interview preparation, particularly those who are shy, inexperienced, or less confident in their communication skills. The traditional approach of mock interviews with real interviewers can be intimidating, leading to a lack of effective preparation.

## Solution
Interview Mentor utilizes the power of artificial intelligence to provide a comfortable and secure platform for mock interviews. This end-to-end AI application offers valuable feedback and an intelligent scoring system to evaluate performance. Key features include high-level security, login profiles, and custom models trained on industry-leading frameworks. All backend processes, including Google-level authentication and session management, are handled seamlessly, ensuring user progress is saved and personalized.

## Working
Upon greeting, Interview Mentor asks users to select their domain of preparation. The system then requests a resume or CV to tailor the experience to the user's background. Users without a CV can proceed without one. The AI then begins domain-specific questioning, providing feedback and scores for each response. The scoring system intelligently handles non-applicable scenarios to ensure seamless JSON responses.
